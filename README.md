# Neuropredictome

`Neuropredictome` is a machine-learning based classification framework optimized for the reliability and robustness of its associations. Grounded in a large-scale dataset, UK-Biobank (N=19,831), participants were assessed with respect to a comprehensive set of phenotypes, including the physical and lifestyle factors most relevant to general medicine. Results generated by data-driven classifiers were then cross-validated, using deep-learning textual analyses, against 14,371 peer-reviewed research articles, providing an unbiased hypothesis-generator of linkages between diverse phenotypes and the brain.

# 3. Demo
`python neuropredictome -x data/X_sample.csv -y data/y_sample.csv -o out`

**--x**: _features (neuroimaging) file for classification_
> `subjs, feature1, feature2, ... age, gender`
> `subj1, 2, 3, ... 22, 0`
> `subj2, 1, 3, ... 52, 0`
> `subj3, 2, 3, ... 42, 1`
> `   ...`
> 
**--y**: _labels (phenotypes) file for classification_ (must be binary)
> `subjs, phenotype1, phenotype2 `
> `subj1, 0, 1`
> `subj2, 1, 0`
> `subj3, 1, 1`
> `...`
> 
**--o**: _output folder where **results.csv**  is written with other classification results_ 
 > `idx,label,n,no_convergence,pct_minority,my_maj_cnt,monkey_maj_cnt,my_recall,monkey_recall,my_precision,monkey_precision,my_acc,monkey_acc,my_f1,monkey_f1,stat,pval,rank`
> `0,phenotype1,25,0,0.038,19,9,0,0,0,0,0.96,0.938,0,0,,,1`
